## Charlie is Cool

Charlie is cool because he can solve complex math problems in his head. For instance, consider the following equation:

$$ x^2 + y^2 = 400 $$

Charlie can quickly determine that if we let x = 20 and y = 0, then the equation holds true. This showcases Charlie's impressive mental math abilities. Additionally, he can rapidly calculate the volume of a sphere in his head, proving his exceptional knowledge of geometry and mathematical calculations.
