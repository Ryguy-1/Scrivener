## Integral of x from 0 to 2

The integral of a function `f(x)` from `a` to `b` can be represented as the area under the curve of the function between these limits. In this case, we are interested in finding the integral of `x` from `0` to `2`.

First, let's find the integral of `x` itself. The integral of a variable `x` is equal to its square over 2:

$$ \int x dx = \frac{x^2}{2} $$

Now, we need to evaluate this integral from `0` to `2`. Plugging in the limits, we get:

$$ \int_0^2 x dx = \frac{(2)^2}{2} - \frac{(0)^2}{2} = 2 - 0 = 2 $$

So, the final answer is: 2

## Writing an SQL Query to Select All from the Table of Animals

To write a simple SQL query that selects all records from the table of animals, you can use the following SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM animals;
```

This query will return all columns and rows from the 'animals' table. It is important to note that this query does not apply any filters or conditions on the data. To further refine your search, you can add additional clauses like WHERE, ORDER BY, or GROUP BY to your SQL statement.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM animals WHERE species = 'reptile';
```

This query will return all columns and rows from the 'animals' table where the 'species' column is equal to 'reptile'. You can also use other conditions, such as comparing values or using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to create more complex queries.

Remember that SQL is a powerful language for managing and retrieving data from relational databases. By understanding its basic syntax and clauses, you can efficiently write queries to select specific information from your tables.

## Stream Operators in Java

Stream operators are a fundamental concept in Java programming that allows developers to process and manipulate data in a declarative manner. They provide a way to transform, filter, and aggregate elements of a collection without changing the original data structure. In this section, we will discuss some common stream operators and demonstrate their usage with an example.

1. `map()`: This operator is used to transform each element of the input stream into another type. For instance, if you have a list of integers, you can use map() to convert them into strings.

Example:
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream().map(x -> x + " is an integer").forEach(System.out::println);
```
Output:
```
1 is an integer
2 is an integer
3 is an integer
4 is an integer
5 is an integer
```

2. `filter()`: This operator allows you to filter elements of the input stream based on a given condition. It returns a new stream containing only the elements that satisfy the specified predicate.

Example:
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
numbers.stream().filter(x -> x % 2 == 0).forEach(System.out::println);
```
Output:
```
2
4
```

3. `sorted()`: This operator sorts the elements of the input stream in ascending order based on their natural ordering or a specified Comparator.

Example:
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(5, 1, 4, 2, 3);
numbers.stream().sorted().forEach(System.out::println);
```
Output:
```
1
2
3
4
5
```

4. `collect()`: This operator is used to collect the elements of the input stream into a single data structure, such as a list, set, or map. It allows you to aggregate and summarize data in various ways.

Example:
```java
List<Integer> numbers = Arrays.asList(1, 2, 3, 4, 5);
int sum = numbers.stream().collect(Collectors.summingInt(x -> x));
System.out.println("Sum of the numbers: " + sum);
```
Output:
```
Sum of the numbers: 15
```

In conclusion, stream operators are a powerful tool for processing and manipulating data in Java. They provide a concise and expressive way to transform, filter, and aggregate elements without mutating the original collection. By understanding and using these operators effectively, developers can write more efficient and maintainable code.
