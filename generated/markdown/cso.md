## Integral of x from 0 to 2

The integral of a function `f(x)` from `a` to `b` can be represented as the area under the curve of the function between these limits. In this case, we are interested in finding the integral of `x` from `0` to `2`.

First, let's find the integral of `x` itself. The integral of a variable `x` is equal to its square over 2:

$$ \int x dx = \frac{x^2}{2} $$

Now, we need to evaluate this integral from `0` to `2`. Plugging in the limits, we get:

$$ \int_0^2 x dx = \frac{(2)^2}{2} - \frac{(0)^2}{2} = 2 - 0 = 2 $$

So, the final answer is: 2

## Writing an SQL Query to Select All from the Table of Animals

To write a simple SQL query that selects all records from the table of animals, you can use the following SELECT statement:

```sql
SELECT * FROM animals;
```

This query will return all columns and rows from the 'animals' table. It is important to note that this query does not apply any filters or conditions on the data. To further refine your search, you can add additional clauses like WHERE, ORDER BY, or GROUP BY to your SQL statement.

For example:

```sql
SELECT * FROM animals WHERE species = 'reptile';
```

This query will return all columns and rows from the 'animals' table where the 'species' column is equal to 'reptile'. You can also use other conditions, such as comparing values or using logical operators (AND, OR, NOT) to create more complex queries.

Remember that SQL is a powerful language for managing and retrieving data from relational databases. By understanding its basic syntax and clauses, you can efficiently write queries to select specific information from your tables.
