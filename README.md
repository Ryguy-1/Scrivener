## What is PaperBox?
PaperBox is a command line tool that allows you to take notes in plain english and convert them in real time to human readable formats in real time. PaperBox is built on top of [Ollama](https://github.com/jmorganca/ollama), using custom LLMs to translate between natural language and any renderable script.
